Experimental results presented in [AGVW17].
The files are in "sagemath object" format. They can be loaded using the `load`
function in Sagemath 7.4+.

The filenames indicate the secret dimension `n`, and the block size `b` used for
BKZ. The number of samples `m`, dimension of the lattice `m+1`, and modulo `q`
can be found in Table 1 [AGVW17].
